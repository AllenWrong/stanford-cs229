This repo records my attempts to finish all excercises from CS229 (Autumn 2017).
http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html

I usually record all details in Jupyter notebooks.

I finished everything except the last problem on Problem set 4, ""Reinforcement
learning: the inverted pendulum problem"". The link to the data seems broken
when I try to work on it. If you have access to the data, please let me know.
I've implemented value iteration and policy iteration before in javascript for
the gridworld at https://rljs.herokuapp.com/gridworld-dp.
