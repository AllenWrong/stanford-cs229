This repo records my answers to all questions from the excercises of CS229
(Autumn 2017). http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html

I tried to record all details in Jupyter notebooks. If you see mistakes, please
let me know.

I answered all questions except the last one on Problem set 4, ""Reinforcement
learning: the inverted pendulum problem"". The link to the data seems broken
when I try to work on it. If you have access to the data, please let me know. As
for reinforcement learning, I've implemented value iteration and policy
iteration before in javascript for the gridworld at
https://github.com/zyxue/rljs with a web demo at
https://rljs.herokuapp.com/.

This project is considered complete for now.
